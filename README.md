# Dev Bot (Rehor)

An autonomous developer agent that picks groomed Jira tickets, implements them, opens PRs, and maintains them through review — all without human intervention. It runs in a polling loop using the Claude Agent SDK (Python) and integrates with Jira, GitHub/GitLab, and a persistent memory system.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the bot, make sure you have the following installed:

| Dependency | Purpose | Install |
|------------|---------|---------|
| [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) | Agent runtime (bundled with the SDK) | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |
| [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) | Python package manager | `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh \| sh` |
| [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) + Docker Compose | Memory server, target repo dev environments | Install Docker Desktop |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) + npm | TypeScript LSP server | `brew install node` or via nvm |
| [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) | JSON processing | `brew install jq` |
| [gh](https://cli.github.com/) | GitHub CLI | `brew install gh` then `gh auth login` (use SSH protocol) |
| [glab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli) | GitLab CLI (only for GitLab repos) | `brew install glab` then `glab auth login` (use SSH protocol) |
| SSH keys | Git access to target repos | Must be configured for GitHub and/or GitLab |

The bot also uses the [mcp-atlassian](https://github.com/sooperset/mcp-atlassian) MCP server for Jira integration (configured in `.mcp.json`).

### Authentication

The bot needs credentials for several services. Set these in `.env` (copy from `.env.example` or create manually):

```bash
# Jira — required
# Generate your API token at: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
JIRA_URL=https://your-instance.atlassian.net
JIRA_USERNAME=your-email@company.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your-jira-api-token

# Claude — GCP Vertex AI (service account)
# Follow the RH internal guide to set up Vertex AI access
# and generate a service account key file (sa-key.json).
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone this repo
git clone <repo-url> dev-bot && cd dev-bot

# 2. Install Python dependencies and set up LSP + memory server
make init

# 3. Create your .env file with credentials (see Authentication above)
cp .env.example .env  # then edit with your values

# 4. Run the bot for a specific team label
make run LABEL=hcc-ai-framework
```

The bot will start polling for Jira tickets with the `hcc-ai-framework` label. It logs to stdout and `bot.log`.

### Available make targets

```
make init              # Full setup: install deps, LSP, start memory server
make run               # Run the bot on host (LABEL=hcc-ai-framework by default)
make run-rbac          # Run the bot with platform-accessmanagement label
make stop              # Stop a running bot (release lock)
make logs              # Tail bot log
make memory-server     # Start memory server + postgres (standalone)
make memory-server-stop # Stop standalone memory server
make docker-up         # Start full stack in Docker (postgres + memory server + bot)
make docker-down       # Stop full stack
make dashboard         # Build the dashboard UI
make costs             # Show all cost data
make costs-today       # Show today's costs
make costs-week        # Show this week's costs
make seed-costs        # Import costs.jsonl into the database
make help              # Show all available commands
```

You can also run the bot directly: `uv run dev-bot --label <your-label>`

## How it works

The bot operates in **cycles**. Each cycle, it evaluates all of its tracked work and acts on exactly one item, following a strict priority order:

### Priority 0: Respond to feedback and finish incomplete work

The bot starts every cycle by checking its tracked tasks for anything that needs immediate attention:

1. **New feedback** — PR review comments, Jira comments, failing CI, or merge conflicts since the bot last addressed a task. Human feedback is always the highest priority.
2. **Interrupted work** — if the bot ran out of turns mid-implementation (branch created but no PR yet), it picks up where it left off using progress metadata.
3. **Unfinished investigations** — investigation tickets where the analysis hasn't been posted to Jira yet.

### Priority 1: Maintain existing PRs

For each open PR, the bot checks (in order): CI failures, merge conflicts, review feedback, Jira comments, and merged PRs. When a PR merges, it closes the task, transitions the Jira ticket to Done, and saves what it learned to memory.

### Priority 1.5: Check assigned Jira tickets

Scans tickets assigned to the bot for merged PRs it hasn't noticed or new Jira comments.

### Priority 2: Pick new work

Only when everything is clean — no pending feedback, no interrupted work, all PRs green — the bot looks for new tickets. It searches memory for relevant past learnings, claims the ticket, creates a branch, implements, tests, and opens a PR.

## Preparing tickets for the bot

Tickets must be explicitly groomed. The bot never picks random backlog items.

### Required labels

- **Primary label** (e.g. `hcc-ai-framework`, `hcc-ai-platform-accessmanagement`) — marks the ticket as bot-eligible for a specific team. The bot only picks up tickets with its configured label.
- **`repo:<name>`** — identifies the target repo (must match a key in `project-repos.json`). A ticket can have multiple `repo:` labels for cross-repo work.

### Optional labels

- `needs-investigation` — bot investigates and reports findings instead of implementing
- `platform-experience-ui` — routes the ticket to the UI sprint (scrum boards only)

### Interactive grooming

There's a prompt that walks you through preparing a ticket:

```bash
claude --prompt-file prompts/groom.md
```

It helps identify repos, suggests labels, and produces a ready-to-create ticket with acceptance criteria.

### What makes a good bot ticket

- **Clear problem statement** — current vs expected behavior
- **Specific files or components** if known (saves the bot time)
- **URL paths** where the issue is visible
- **Acceptance criteria** as a concrete checklist
- **Scoped to a single PR** — if it's too big, split it

The bot is a good developer but has zero tribal knowledge. Don't assume it knows your team's history.

## Adding a new repo

1. Add to `project-repos.json`:
   ```json
   "my-repo": {
     "url": "git@github.com:RedHatInsights/my-repo.git",
     "personas": ["frontend"]
   }
   ```
2. Add a `repo:my-repo` label to the Jira ticket

The bot clones repos automatically when it picks up a ticket.

### Fork repos

If the bot doesn't have push access to the upstream repo, use a fork:

```json
"app-interface": {
  "url": "git@gitlab.cee.redhat.com:youruser/app-interface.git",
  "upstream": "git@gitlab.cee.redhat.com:service/app-interface.git",
  "personas": ["config"],
  "host": "gitlab"
}
```

The bot clones from the fork, syncs from upstream, pushes branches to the fork, and opens MRs targeting the upstream repo.

### Multi-persona repos

A repo can support multiple personas. The bot selects the best fit based on the ticket:

```json
"insights-rbac": {
  "url": "git@github.com:RedHatInsights/insights-rbac.git",
  "personas": ["backend", "rbac"]
}
```

If a ticket is about RBAC-specific Django work, the bot loads the `rbac` persona. For generic backend work, it uses `backend`.

## Running the services

### Option A: Bot on host, memory server in Docker (recommended)

The recommended setup for development. The bot runs directly on your machine using your local Claude Code credentials, while the memory server runs in Docker:

```bash
# Start memory server + postgres
make memory-server

# Run bot on host (uses localhost:8080 for memory server)
make run LABEL=hcc-ai-framework
```

This is the easiest way to get started — no need for service account keys or bot-specific GitHub credentials. The bot uses your local Claude Code auth and your personal gh/glab CLI sessions.

### Option B: Full stack in Docker

For production-like deployments or CI — everything runs in containers with dedicated bot credentials:

```bash
# Set secrets (or add to .env — see SOP.md for details)
export SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_B64=$(base64 -i .ssh/id_ed25519)
export GPG_PRIVATE_KEY_B64=$(base64 -i .ssh/gpg-private.asc)
export GH_TOKEN=<your-pat>
export GOOGLE_SA_KEY_B64=$(base64 -i sa-key.json)

# Start everything
make docker-up

# Override the bot label
BOT_LABEL=hcc-ai-platform-accessmanagement make docker-up

# Stop
make docker-down
```

### Memory server + dashboard

The memory server runs as Docker containers (PostgreSQL with pgvector + Python app). `make init` starts it automatically.

```bash
make memory-server              # Start
make memory-server-stop         # Stop
```

Dashboard at **http://localhost:8080** — tasks, memories, semantic search, 3D embedding map. Live WebSocket updates.

### Browser for visual verification

For UI changes, the bot uses chrome-devtools MCP to take screenshots. Start a Chrome/Chromium instance with remote debugging:

```bash
./start-chromium.sh
```

This launches Chrome on port 9222 with a separate profile. Edit the script to use `chromium` if that's what you have.

### 3. Configuration

`config.json` controls the bot's behavior:

```json
{
  "claude": {
    "maxTurns": 100,
    "model": "claude-opus-4-6"
  },
  "polling": {
    "intervalSeconds": 300,
    "idleIntervalSeconds": 3600
  }
}
```

MCP servers are configured in `.mcp.json` (project-level) and `personas/*/mcp.json` (per-persona tools).

## Personas

Each repo has one or more personas that provide domain-specific guidelines. Personas live in `personas/<type>/prompt.md`:

| Persona | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| `frontend` | React/TypeScript/PatternFly repos. Visual verification, `npm run lint/test`. |
| `backend` | Go and Node.js backend services. |
| `rbac` | Django/DRF RBAC service (insights-rbac). Docker Compose dev env, `make unittest-fast`. |
| `operator` | Kubernetes operators (Go). |
| `config` | Config repos (app-interface). Read-only or GitLab MR workflow. |
| `cve` | CVE remediation — dependency upgrades and security scanning. |

## Memory system

The bot has persistent memory via MCP:

- **Task tracking** — structured records of active work with status, PR links, and progress metadata. Hard cap of 5 concurrent active tasks. When interrupted mid-cycle, the bot saves progress (`last_step`, `next_step`, `files_changed`) so the next cycle resumes seamlessly.
- **RAG memory** — vector-searchable knowledge base of learnings from completed tickets, PR review feedback, and codebase patterns. The bot searches this before starting any new ticket, so it improves over time.

## Cost tracking

Each cycle records its cost to `costs.jsonl` and the memory server database.

```bash
make costs           # All recorded cycles
make costs-today     # Today only
make costs-week      # Last 7 days
./costs.sh 2026-03-31   # Specific date
./costs.sh backfill     # Import from bot.log
```

The dashboard at http://localhost:8080 also shows cost charts with per-cycle breakdowns by work type.
